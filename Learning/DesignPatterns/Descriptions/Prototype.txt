A prototype pattern is used in software development when
the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, 
which is cloned to produce new objects. 
This pattern is used, for example, 
when the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the new keyword) 
is prohibitively expensive for a given application.
