The Proxy Pattern will provide an object a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used when you need to represent a complex object with a simpler one. If creation of an object is expensive, it can be postponed until the very need arises and meanwhile a simpler object can serve as a placeholder. This placeholder object is called the “Proxy” for the complex object.
