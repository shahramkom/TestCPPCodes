Without violating encapsulation the Memento Pattern will capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. Though the Gang of Four uses friend as a way to implement this pattern it is not the best design[citation needed]. It can also be implemented using PIMPL (pointer to implementation or opaque pointer). Best Use case is 'Undo-Redo' in an editor.

The Originator (the object to be saved) creates a snap-shot of itself as a Memento object, and passes that reference to the Caretaker object. The Caretaker object keeps the Memento until such a time as the Originator may want to revert to a previous state as recorded in the Memento object.
